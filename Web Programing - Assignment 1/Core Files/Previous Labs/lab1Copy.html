    <p> Peterborough was once known as a flourishing city with a growing industy presence.
        Unfortunately, this is no longer the case and many of these keystone businesses have since relocated or closed
        down.
        At present, Peterborough is known as a retirement city, housing a staggering amount
        of retirement homes. Arguably the only thing of note now in Peterborough is the once famous Liftlocks,
        which championed the highest hydraulic boat lift in the world for some time. It was able to raise boats upwards
        of 65 ft.
