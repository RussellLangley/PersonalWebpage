        <div id="objective">
            <p>
                There came a moment not long before I enrolled in Computer Programming
                where I thought long and hard about where I'd like to be
                employed in five years. Of course, there are plenty of worthy careers out
                there to be tried, but I realized that the time I spend working now is a
                type of an investment. And since I only have so much to invest, how
                would I go about investing it? I realized that an ideal career for me is one that
                will keep me mentally stimulated, one that has potential longevity, perhaps
                even demand, in a drastically changing labour market, and finally a career that
                will allow me to keep myself in good health and not contribute to its degradation.
                At the time and still today, at least as an outsider looking in, a career in programming
                seemed to fill those boxes, and that is why I have formatted the below resume
                to focus more on what an employer of that field may be interested in.
